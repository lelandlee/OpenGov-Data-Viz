Data would be better if could query a relational database
Why is there signifigant lag when using the website?

better to query data or grab all?
Create a table at the bottom? to go along with chart?
Concatinate all the JSON files together rather than add to a object array...


use getSingleMetricData() to send data that is grabbed from the Select View...

Add maps with data points -> when click -> show on chart

Had two options for accessing info:
-grab from local data structure -> everything is preloaded -> less delay later
-use elastic search for each one...

show two charts -> adjusted + non adjusted

Calculate averages -> aggregate + regional + current selection
